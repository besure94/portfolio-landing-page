			<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/favorite-band.git">Favorite Band</a></li>
			<p>This website allows users to view a description of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, their biography, a list of my favorite albums of theirs and a schedule of their 2023 tour and upcoming shows. This website uses the languages HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is not complete, but it is the project I have worked on the most.</p>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/wikipedia-rebuild.git">Wikipedia Rebuild</a></li>
			<p>This website visually resembles the Wikipedia homepage. It is designed to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It demonstrates my understanding of elements such as divs, classes, floats, spans, id's, containers, jumbotrons, etc. Users can view the same information they would see on the Wikipedia homepage, styled in the same format.</p>
