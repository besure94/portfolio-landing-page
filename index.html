			<p>This website allows users to view a description of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, their biography, a list of my favorite albums of theirs and a schedule of their 2023 tour and upcoming shows.

			<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/wikipedia-rebuild.git">Wikipedia Rebuild</a></li>
			<p>This website visually resembles the Wikipedia homepage. It is designed to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It demonstrates my understanding of elements such as divs, classes, floats, spans, id's, containers, jumbotrons, etc. Users can view the same information they would see on the Wikipedia homepage, styled in the same format.</p>

			<p>This website allows users to view a page for my dream vacation to Greece. Users can view information about Greek architecture, culture, history, island, scenery, and food. There are also three vacation packages which users can choose from. This website uses the languages HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is not fully complete, but I plan to work on it more as I gain more knowledge of coding.</p>

			<p>This website allows users to view five animals that are up for adoption, with a description of each animal. This website uses the languages HTML and CSS. I plan to add more to it as I gain more knowledge of coding.</p>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/music-website.git">Music Website</a></li>
