			<h2><span class="delay">My projects</span></h2>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/favorite-band.git" id="link">Favorite Band</a></li>
				<p>This website allows users to view a description of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, their biography, a list of my favorite albums of theirs and a schedule of their 2023 tour and upcoming shows. This website uses the languages HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is not complete, but it is the project I have worked on the most.</p>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/wikipedia-rebuild.git" id="link">Wikipedia Rebuild</a></li>
				<p>This website visually resembles the Wikipedia homepage. It is designed to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It demonstrates my understanding of elements such as divs, classes, floats, spans, id's, containers, jumbotrons, etc. Users can view the same information they would see on the Wikipedia homepage, styled in the same format.</p>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/vacation-site.git" id="link">Vacation Site</a></li>
				<p>This website allows users to view a page for my dream vacation to Greece. Users can view information about Greek architecture, culture, history, island, scenery, and food. There are also three vacation packages which users can choose from. This website uses the languages HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is not fully complete, but I plan to work on it more as I gain more knowledge of coding.</p>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/animal-shelter-website.git" id="link">Animal Shelter Website</a></li>
				<p>This website allows users to view five animals that are up for adoption, with a description of each animal. This website uses the languages HTML and CSS. I plan to add more to it as I gain more knowledge of coding.</p>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/bscherner/music-website.git"id="link">Music Website</a></li>
				<p>This website allows users to read about my musical interests and explore some of my favorite genres and artists. Users can also navigate to another website that showcases my own musical project, Sins N Grins. I plan to add a lot more to this website as I gain more knowledge of coding. This website uses the languages HTML and CSS.</p>

			<h2><span class="delay">About Me</span></h2>
			<img src="img/forest.jpg" alt="A photo of Brian in a forest." class="forest">
			<p>I am a 28 year old man originally from the Portland, OR area (<strong><em>a rarity these days!</em></strong>). I'm a pretty quiet, laid back person and I tend to open up and talk more to people I feel comfortable with and trust. Growing up I always excelled in liberal arts subjects such as History, English, Psychology, and Sociology. My educational background is a high school diploma and about two years of a college education. I did well in college but I never really knew what I wanted to do, and it didn't seem worthwhile to continue without knowing what my goals were. My work experience includes food service, retail, data entry, manufacturing, and warehouses. I have spent the bulk of my working years in warehouses where I operated forklifts and other heavy equipment. While I excelled at my positions in warehouses, it was never really something I was that passionate about, and I knew that it was not something I wanted to do long term.</p>
			<p>One thing I noticed about all the jobs I had worked was that I did best when I could work independently, with little supervision. I am an internally motivated person and I can achieve results based on my own drive to succeed and not necessarily external pressure. As I learned more about programming, I discovered that these traits can be an asset. I did take a web design course in high school and I did quite well in it. This was back in 2010, and the content was only basic HTML, but I remember enjoying the class a lot. This small introduction to programming, combined with an aptitude at problem solving, attention to detail, and a strong memory (and also a desire to earn more money, to be perfectly honest), led me to pursue a career in programming. A good friend of mine went to Epicodus and had nothing but good things to say about it. After teaching myself some basic coding, I decided that it was something I wanted to fully pursue. Here I am!</p>

			<h2><span class="delay">Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</span></h2>
			<img src="img/guitar.jpg" alt="A photo of Brian playing guitar." class="guitar">
			<ul class="interests">
				<li>I am a <strong><em>huge</em></strong> lover of music. I play guitar and sing, and I listen to a wide variety of genres such as punk rock, indie, shoegaze, psychedelic rock, folk, folk punk, hip hop, and many more! I've lost count of how many shows I've been to over the years. I would describe the music I play as folk punk or acoustic punk rock.</li>
				<li>Like your typical Pacific Northwest resident, I love spending time out in nature.</li>
				<li>I'm a huge history nerd and spend a lot of my free time reading about it. I tend to focus on social justice movements, civil unrest, and military history, particularly in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. In addition to history, I spend a lot of my free time reading about sociology and psychology.</li>
				<li>Although I'm currently not playing any sports, I am an athletic guy and I have played baseball, boxed, and spent a lot of time lifting weights. I played other sports growing up, but I did best at baseball.</li>
				<li>I have a memory like a steel trap. People always comment on how I can remember even the most seemingly insignificant things from years, or even decades, ago.</li>
				<li>I have an eye for small details and tend to notice a lot of things that other people do not.</li>
				<li>I'm a certified forklift operator and also have certifications in first aid, OSHA, and CPR.</li>
