## Description

This website allows users to view a portfolio for Brian Scherner. Users can view three images below Brian's name, as well as a list of five projects he is currently working on.

Each link will enlarge when you hover over it, and each heading will also enlarge when you hover over it. There is an "About Me" section where users can learn more about Brian and his story.
